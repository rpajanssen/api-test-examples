/**
 * Example JAX-RS response filter to demonstrate using JAX-RS filters and how to test them in an Jersey unit integration test.
 *
 * A filter is suitable for processing the metadata associated with a message: HTTP headers, query parameters,
 * media type, and other metadata. Filters have the capability to abort a message invocation (useful for security
 * plug-ins, for example).
 *
 * You can install multiple filters at each extension point, in which case the filters are executed in a chain
 * (the order of execution is undefined, unless you specify a priority value for each installed filter).
 *
 * Note: this is a server response filter that runs on the server processing the outgoing http response. You can also
 * implement client response filters post-processing the response right after it is received. Then you need to implement
 * the ClientResponseFilter interface.
 *
 * Filters let us modify the properties of the incoming requests and returned responses â€“ for example, HTTP headers.
